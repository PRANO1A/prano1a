## Am I really fine, or am I just really good at lying?

  What's my name? Oh shit, man, I have so many names.. Paranoia, Noah/Noah, Ellie/Ellias, Marley, Hallucination, but now I mostly use Paranoia/Noah. 

pronouns? any.

  I'm 16 years old, I'm a teenager who hates companies, I feel UNCOMFORTABLE in them. I'd rather leave than tolerate people. I don't share my friends with my other friends, sorry, but no. 
Pansexual, please don't be homophobic. I'm crying already.. ISFP, a complex child, an introvert .I love role-playing games

✧   I love flirting

  We're friends, but don't tell me how nice I am just because you've known me for a few days. I'm a diverse person. 
I don't have a relationship, and I don't plan on getting one anytime soon.

c*h and int are always allowed

 ... I want to be loved, but I'm afraid of making mistakes again.

 You already know my name, and if you want to start a conversation, please don't immediately perceive me as a comfortable and polite person. I am completely different, a multifaceted individual who doesn't have a clear "true" self. Instead, I wear masks and personalities, and I lie about my true feelings. I can withdraw into myself, disappear abruptly, and return just as suddenly. If I become attached, I may distance myself out of fear of falling in love or being abandoned. I am always open to communication and spending time together in silence.

something between a fox and a dog.

my diskord : @prano1a 

I'm a music lover, but I mostly listen to Alex G, Cavetown, mcCafferty, Mr. Kitty, and similar artists.
