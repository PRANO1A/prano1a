  What's my name? Oh shit, man, I have so many names.. Paranoia, Noah, Ellie/Ellias, Marley, Hallucination, but now I mostly use **_Paranoia/Noah._**

pronouns? _any._

  **_I'm 16 years old_**, I'm a teenager who hates companies, I feel **_UNCOMFORTABLE_** in them. I'd rather leave than tolerate people. I don't share my friends with my other friends, sorry, but no. 
Pansexual, please don't be homophobic. I'm crying already.. ISFP, a complex child, an introvert .I love role-playing games

✧   I love flirting

 Well, don't judge a book by its cover. The cover may be beautiful, but the inside is rotting.

I don't have a relationship, and I don't plan on getting one anytime soon.

 _You already know my name, and if you want to start a conversation, please don't take me for who I seem to be at first glance. I am a completely different, diverse person who doesn't have a clear sense of myself. Instead, I adapt my personality to the person I'm with. I often lie about my true feelings because I don't want to burden others with my problems. I can be introverted, suddenly disappear, and return just as suddenly. Sometimes I say things without thinking, and if my words or actions have hurt you, please let me know. If I become attached, I may withdraw out of fear of falling in love or being abandoned. I am always open to communication and spending time together in silence._

_something between a fox and a dog._
